### Problems Faced During the Project 
[APK for the Application](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XxRoCm5IJuLczxLHA6PBqnM7TMupWlza?usp=sharing)
1. The First Problem which arised during the process was using RxJava or Coroutines for the API Call . Since i am Familiar with Both , Coroutines was chosen over rxjava because it was more simpler to code 

2. The Second Problem was to choose the Architecture Pattern for the Application. As i had hands on with MVVM Architecture i choose to go with it as it is best pattern for the android application

3. The Application included fetching data from API a problem was raised when weather data  for a particular date could not be fetched from the Free API.
